## Project Overview
The Analytics Engine Project is a web application designed to aggregate and display various organizational and content-related data using visual charts. The primary goal is to provide insightful visualizations that help users understand different dimensions of the data such as industry distribution, geographic location, and content categorization.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Database**: TSV (Tab Separated Values) files
- **Deployment**: Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)
- **Additional Libraries**: Recharts (for charting), CORS, nodemon

## Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Data Sources**: Integrating more data sources and types, such as relational databases or external APIs, to provide richer and more diverse datasets.

2. **Advanced Visualizations**: Implementing more complex visualizations and analytics features, such as time-series analysis or predictive analytics, to provide deeper insights.

3. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Adding user authentication and role-based access control to allow personalized data views and secure data management.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing the performance of data processing and visualization rendering to handle larger datasets more efficiently.

5. **Improved UI/UX**: Refining the user interface and user experience to make the application more intuitive and user-friendly, including responsive design improvements and accessibility features.

By building upon this foundation, the Analytics Engine Project aims to become a comprehensive tool for data visualization and analysis, catering to a wide range of user needs and scenarios.
